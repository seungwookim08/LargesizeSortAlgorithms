# External Sort Algorithms
This project shows external sorting algorithms, mainly where there is a main memory cannot fit all the loaded data and should use disk to sort. 
One method is called Two PHase Multiway Sort (TPMMS) algorithms. You may find more information here http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~cheung/Courses/554/Syllabus/4-query-exec/2-pass=TPMMS.html 
Another method is used with bitmap indexes. Much less effective compared to TPMMS. More information will be available here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitmap_index 
For each project folder, I specifcy more information. 
Thanks.
